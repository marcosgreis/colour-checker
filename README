This is a project to solve the VanHackathon challenge from Thalmic Labs.

Requirements:
* CMake 3.0
* Boost C++ Libraries 1.54 (program_options and unit_test_framework)



The activities needed to complete this task are:

Act#0: Create basic structure
Act#1: Read input files
Act#2: Parse data
Act#3: Create colour matching function
Act#4: Calculate light colour
Act#10: Command-line tool
Act#11: Add a filter to remove noise from the measurement data
Act#8: Determine light stability

During the development, I was told that the GUI was not neccessary.
Therefore, these activities do not apply:
-- Act#5: Create GUI
-- Act#6: Integrate with libcolourcheck
-- Act#7: Show data
-- Act#9: Show stability in GUI
